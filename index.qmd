# Welcome {.unnumbered}

**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a dynamic online book rooted in the teachings of the annual graduate course, FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, a key part of the curriculum in the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) at Universidade Federal de Viçosa.

Designed for those passionate about studying and modeling plant disease epidemics with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the book offers an exploration of diverse methods for describing, visualizing, and analyzing epidemic data collected over time and space. Readers should ideally have a foundational knowledge of R to best utilize the examples.

However, R4PDE is not a resource for learning data science through R, as there are already well-established books such as [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for that purpose. This book draws on multiple sources, but in certain sections, it utilizes data and replicates (with permission) some of the analyses (presented in SAS codes) from [*The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics*](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/book/10.1094/9780890545058) [@madden2007], a highly recommended textbook for anyone wishing to delve deeply into plant disease epidemiology.

A mix of general and specific R packages are utilized to conduct common plant disease epidemiology data analysis, notably [{epifitter}](https://alvesks.github.io/epifitter/) and [{epiphy}](https://chgigot.github.io/epiphy/), both designed by plant pathologists. In conjunction with this book, a new R package [{r4pde}](https://github.com/emdelponte/r4pde) has been developed and can be installed from GitHub using:

```         
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("emdelponte/r4pde")
```
