# Welcome {.unnumbered}

**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a dynamic book project rooted in the teachings of the annual graduate course, FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, a key part of the curriculum in the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) at Universidade Federal de Viçosa.

Designed for those passionate about studying and modeling plant disease epidemics with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the book offers an exploration of diverse methods for describing, visualizing, and analyzing epidemic data collected over time or space. Readers should ideally have a foundational knowledge of R to best utilize the examples.

However, R4PDE is not a resource for learning data science through R, as there are already well-established books such as [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for that purpose. Portuguese-speaking readers are recommended [Análises Ecológicas no R](https://analises-ecologicas.netlify.app/) and [Software R para avaliação de dados experimentais](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/e-bookr/index.html) as excellent R learning resources, with an added focus on statistics using R.

The book often draws upon data and replicates analyses from *The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics* [@madden2007]. A mix of general and specific R packages are utilized to conduct common plant disease epidemiology data analysis, notably [{epifitter}](https://alvesks.github.io/epifitter/) and [{epiphy}](https://chgigot.github.io/epiphy/), both designed by plant pathologists. In conjunction with this book, a new R package [{r4pde}](https://github.com/emdelponte/r4pde) has been developed and can be installed from GitHub using:

    #install.packages("remotes")

    remotes::install_github("emdelponte/r4pde")

As a work in progress, the book is frequently updated and edited. The website is free to use, licensed under a [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), and the code for all analyses can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R). While there are no immediate plans for a printed version, it is under consideration as the book further develops. The website is hosted by https://www.netlify.com/.
