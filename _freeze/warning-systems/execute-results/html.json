Since the early 1900s, warning systems (synonyms: disease forecaster, predictor) have advanced considerably. More comprehensively, these systems have evolved to a Decision Support System (DSS), when they integrate expert input, models, and databases for more nuanced management recommendations, transcending simple prediction to encompass various goals within computerized frameworks. In fact, technological progress in recent decades has boosted the development and automation of decision support system (DSS), now widely available in public and private sectors, providing direct, sophisticated guidance to crop advisors and growers (@fig-dss).\n\n![Core elements of a decision support system that provides risk information for plant disease management](imgs/dss.png){#fig-dss fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn its core, a DSS for plant disease management are based on a disease **model**, or a simplified, often mathematical, representation of a the system (here the pathosystem) used for making predictions or suggesting management decisions based on the risk information they provide. The models range from basic rules (e.g. if-then) and static thresholds to sophisticated simulation models covering entire disease epidemics. Usually these models depend on weather information, that are collected on site in automatic weather stations or, more recently, from remote sensing or data reanalysis sources, as input and are improved and tested with field data.\n\n## Risk assessment and decision framework\n\nThere are basically two types of decisions related to plant disease management: tactical and strategical and these can be related to the distinct time frames of information (i.e., historical data, pre-season, growing season, and future seasons) used in risk assessment. A risk assessment and decision framework with associated terminology can be proposed based on such relations (@fig-timeline) and its components are explained next.\n\n![Framework and associated terminology for plant disease risk assessment](imgs/timeline.png){#fig-timeline fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**Historical** prediction refers to those obtained from or simulated for previous years or seasons. This can include past observed weather patterns, observed or simulated disease outbreaks. In the p**re-season** period, predictions are made before the actual planting or growing season starts. This could be based on early predictions of seasonal weather patterns. During the **growing season,** real-time data is used to provide short-term predictions. This is the period when crops are in the fields and are actively monitored. Finally, for **future seasons,** projections (e.g. climate change scenarios) can be made for subsequent years or planting seasons.\n\n**Strategical** are decisions that have a long-term impact and are typically based on historical data and forecasts for future seasons. Examples might include choosing where to plant the crops in the next years, which cultivar to plant, and making infrastructure investments. **Tactical** are short-term decisions typically based on real-time data or short-term predictions, especially those relevant to the current growing season. A key example include the application of fungicide sprays.\n\nAs to terminology, **risk analysis** is a comprehensive assessment of potential disease risks, considering both historical data and projections of the future. The goal is to understand and mitigate potential threats to agricultural production. **Risk prediction** can be broken down into a) **outlook:** Broad predictions or estimations about potential risks, often based on pre-season data. Example: El Ni√±o Southern Oscilation (ENSO) information; b) **forecasting:** Short-term predictions, typically for the growing season, about specific risks such as critical weather events; and c) **warning:** Immediate alerts about imminent risks, like an upcoming risk of plant infection, crucial for tactical decisions.\n\nIn this chapter we will focus on warning system that make use of disease monitoring or seasonal weather to provide risk information for tactical decisions.\n\n## When is a warning system needed?\n\nThe figure and the box below provide some information on their utility. In the figure, risk analysis is defined as an approach for pathogens/diseases that are not present in a target region and for which modeling can be used for risk estimation if the disease is highly damaging were it occurs. Warning systems can be used if the disease is more erratic but still damaging when it occurs. If the epidemics are too frequent but no effective and economic control is available (for example, some nematodes and virus), plant host resistance is the way to go. If there is an effective and economic control (e.g. fungicide sprays) during the season, farmers should apply scheduled treatments given the high risk of the disease.\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-diagram2\n%%| fig-cap: \"Decision chart for the need of risk analysis, warning systems, schedule treatment or host resistance in disease management\"\n%%| fig-width: 4\nflowchart\n    Start((Start))\n    A{Disease<BR>present?}\n    B{Highly<BR>damaging?}\n    C[Risk Analysis]\n    D{Damaging?}\n    E{Frequent<BR>epidemics?}\n    F[Scheduled treatments]\n    G[Warning System]\n    H{Economic<BR>control?}\n    I[Host Resistance]\n\n    Start --> A\n    A -->|N| B\n    B -->|N| Start\n    D -->|N| Start\n    A -->|Y| D\n    D -->|Y| E\n    E -->|Y| H\n    B -->|Y| C\n    E -->|N| G\n    H -->|N| I\n    H -->|Y| F\n    \n\n```\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n## When is a warning system useful?\n\nFor operational and economical use, warning systems must fulfill four criteria to be practical. A more comprehensive discussion on this topic is presented in [@Campbell1990]:\n\n1.  They should target diseases that are prevalent and economically damaging, affecting yield or quality. Merely having severe economic consequences doesn't guarantee a system's practical use or attention from growers and advisors.\n\n2.  The diseases should exhibit variability across seasons in terms of onset, epidemic growth rate, severity, or another aspect, creating uncertainty in decision-making. Diseases with predictable patterns provide minimal information and little management advantage, reducing the relevance of warning systems.\n\n3.  Users should be capable of acting on the system's alerts, necessitating available and effective control measures and sufficient response time to prevent crop damage. Systems are unhelpful if practitioners can't adapt their strategies promptly.\n\n4.  The system must encompass comprehensive knowledge about the disease, synthesizing accurate risk estimates. Understanding the specific interactions between host, pathogen, and environment is crucial for the system's effectiveness and relevance.\n:::\n\n## What types of systems are there?\n\nThese systems vary significantly in structure and design, reflecting the multitude of plant diseases, objectives, available data, control strategies, developer preferences, and operational infrastructures. Usually, warning system as based on weather inputs, but they might leverage other inputs like host, pathogen, and economic factors, catering to the complexities of disease prediction.\n\nDisease warning systems can include simple rules of thumb (e.g. if-then), static or dynamic disease thresholds, direct detection of inoculum, empirically-derived risk models, or complex simulation models that estimate all phases of an epidemic. The underlying models in these systems can be grouped into two different basic types: i) Empirical, based on statistical correlations with disease data; ii) Mechanistic (process-based), constructed around understood cause-effect relationships within disease progression. Let's see some examples of these systems together with their implementation in R.\n\n### Disease threshold\n\nDamaging thresholds, integral to integrated pest management in entomology, can serve as basic disease warning system. They involve economic injury levels, denoting pest abundance that equates control costs with incurred losses, and economic or action thresholds, indicating when action is necessary to avoid reaching injury levels. These concepts, while straightforward, can be quite complex in practical scenarios.\n\nThough less prevalent than in arthropod management, thresholds guide actions like fungicide application in plant diseases, especially those directly impacting yield through photosynthetic area reduction. However, their application is challenging for rapid, recurrent diseases affecting high-value crops, requiring prompt intervention even at minimal disease levels. With potato late blight, for instance, the first fungicide application may need to be applied by the time disease severity reaches as low as 0.1% of the foliage. Hence, disease monitoring for detection and quantification is vital for this system. In reality, for such rapid spreading and highly damaging diseases one cannot wait to \"see\" the disease to start protecting the crops, for which yield protection is best when applications are made preventatively.\n\nHowever, the concept of **economic damage threshold** (EDT) may be used as a criteria do indicate when to start with fungicide sprays. By definition, EDT is the amount of disease intensity (e.g. severity when dealing with foliar diseases) that corresponds to an economic loss that equates the control cost to combat the disease. A formula for the EDT was proposed by Mumford and Norton [@mumford1984] further modified by Reis [@reis2002modelo] for use in foliar fungal diseases, as described in Equation 3:\n\n$EDT = \\frac{F_C}{C_P . D_C} . C_e$ ,\n\nwhere EDT is the disease intensity, $F_C$ is the fungicide cost (USD/ha), $C_P$ is the crop selling price (USD/ton), $D_C$ is the damage coefficient (adjusted to potential yield) and $C_e$ is the control efficacy of the fungicide (proportion of disease reduction relative to non-treated). In practice, sprays should be applied prior to reaching the EDT, which gives rise to the ADT (action damage threshold).\n\nIn a study on northern corn leaf blight in Argentina, the following values were used to calculate the EDT [@derossi2022]. Note that the authors adjusted the Dc to potential yield by multiplying by the potential yield value (8.5 ton.ha) in metric tons, since the Dc is normalized to one metric ton. More about Dc in the dedicated chapter on [yield loss](yieldloss-regression-models.html#damage-coefficients). The action damage threshold (ADT) was defined in that study as 20% reduction of the EDT.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='warning-systems_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_801088ce966329a0040de66dd2821fe6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate_EDT <- function(Fc, Cp, Dc, Ec) {\n  EDT <- (Fc / (Cp * Dc)) * Ce\n  return(EDT)\n}\nFc <- 30      # fixed cost of control is 30 USD/ha.\nCp <- 112     # fixed crop price is 112 USD/ton.\nDc <- 0.1712  # for potential yield of 8.5 t/ha so 8.5 x 0.02015 = 0.1712.\nCe <- 0.70    # control efficacy of fungicide is 70%.\nEDT_value <- calculate_EDT(Fc, Cp, Dc, Ce)\nprint(EDT_value)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.09521\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nADT = EDT_value * 0.80\nADT\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8761682\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Monitoring within-season weather\n\nDisease warning systems frequently predict conditions conducive to infection of the plant by the pathogen, with wetness and temperature being key variables for many foliar diseases. BLITECAST, the first computerized system [@krause1975blitecast], exemplifies this in its monitoring of late blight in potatoes and tomatoes. While initial inoculum is often undetectable, the presence of inoculum of the pathogen is assumed. Accurate predictions of an outbreak are possible by tracking environmental conditions favorable for disease development.\n\nWeather-driven disease warning systems, like FAST and Wallin [@madden1978; @wallin1962], continuously monitor moisture and temperature for various crop diseases. These systems calculate weather favorability or severity values from environmental data, predicting infection and disease severity. These systems guide growers on optimal spraying schedules, initiating treatments or determining application intervals based on accumulated severity values over time.\n\n#### Wallin model\n\nJ.R. Wallin developed a model in the mid-20th century focusing on forecasting potato late blight, detailed across several publications [@wallin1962]. The model tracks hourly relative humidity and temperature, emphasizing periods with relative humidity of 90% or more. It calculates the number of high-humidity hours and corresponding minimum and maximum temperatures. By accumulating 'disease severity values' (DSV) from plant emergence throughout the season, based on humidity and temperature measures, the model predicts the initial onset and subsequent spread of potato late blight. The table below summarizes the way the DSVs are obtained based on combinations of hours of relative humdity \\> 90% and the air temperature within the wet period.\n\n**Table.** Relationship of temperature and relative humidity (RH) periods as used in the Wallin late blight forecasting system to predict disease severity values (0 to 4).\n\n|                           |       |          |       |       |      |\n|---------------------------|-------|----------|-------|-------|------|\n|                           | Daily | severity | value |       |      |\n| Average Temperature Range | 0     | 1        | 2     | 3     | 4    |\n| 7.2 - 11.6 C              | 15    | 16-18    | 19-21 | 22-24 | \\>25 |\n| 11.7 - 15.0 C             | 12    | 13-15    | 16-18 | 19-21 | \\>22 |\n| 15.1 - 26.6 C             | 9     | 10-12    | 13-15 | 16-18 | \\>19 |\n\nLet's calculate DVS in R based on Wallin's system.

The weather data for this simulation is sourced from the NASA Power project via the {nasapower} R package.\n\n[![Screenshot of a web-based warning system for plant diseases based on Wallin's and FAST rules](imgs/ws_systems.png){#fig-ws_systems fig-align=\"center\"}](https://epidemiologiaufv.shinyapps.io/warning-systems/)\n\n## Bonus code\n\nHere is a code to calculate daily DSV values based on the FAST table [@madden1978] that relates the hours of relative humidity \\> 90% (wet period) and temperature during the wet period during a 24-hour period.\n\n| Mean temp (¬∞C) | 0   | 1    | 2     | 3     | 4   |\n|----------------|-----|------|-------|-------|-----|\n| 13-17          | 0-6 | 7-15 | 16-20 | 21+   | 23+ |\n| 18-20          | 0-3 | 4-8  | 9-15  | 16-22 | 23+ |\n| 21-25          | 0-2 | 3-5  | 6-12  | 13-20 | 21+ |\n| 26-29          | 0-3 | 4-8  | 9-15  | 16-22 | 23+ |\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='warning-systems_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_da2d97ebf1343686ce5837ec5e299fd9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n df_fast <- weather2 %>% \n      mutate(\n        DSV = case_when(\n          # Temperature Range: 13 <= T < 18\n          Air_LWD >= 13 & Air_LWD < 18 & LWD >= 0 & LWD <= 6 ~ 0,\n          Air_LWD >= 13 & Air_LWD < 18 & LWD >= 7 & LWD <= 15 ~ 1,\n          Air_LWD >= 13 & Air_LWD < 18 & LWD >= 16 & LWD <= 20 ~ 2,\n          Air_LWD >= 13 & Air_LWD < 18 & LWD > 20 ~ 3,\n          \n          # Temperature Range: 18 <= T < 21\n          Air_LWD >= 18 & Air_LWD < 21 & LWD >= 0 & LWD <= 3 ~ 0,\n          Air_LWD >= 18 & Air_LWD < 21 & LWD >= 4 & LWD <= 8 ~ 1,\n          Air_LWD >= 18 & Air_LWD < 21 & LWD >= 9 & LWD <= 15 ~ 2,\n          Air_LWD >= 18 & Air_LWD < 21 & LWD >= 16 & LWD <= 22 ~ 3,\n          Air_LWD >= 18 & Air_LWD < 21 & LWD > 22 ~ 4,\n          \n          # Temperature Range: 21 <= T < 26\n          Air_LWD >= 21 & Air_LWD < 26 & LWD >= 0 & LWD <= 2 ~ 0,\n          Air_LWD >= 21 & Air_LWD < 26 & LWD >= 3 & LWD <= 5 ~ 1,\n          Air_LWD >= 21 & Air_LWD < 26 & LWD >= 6 & LWD <= 12 ~ 2,\n          Air_LWD >= 21 & Air_LWD < 26 & LWD >= 13 & LWD <= 20 ~ 3,\n          Air_LWD >= 21 & Air_LWD < 26 & LWD > 20 ~ 4,\n          \n          # Temperature Range: 26 <= T < 30\n          Air_LWD >= 26 & Air_LWD < 30 & LWD >= 0 & LWD <= 3 ~ 0,\n          Air_LWD >= 26 & Air_LWD < 30 & LWD >= 4 & LWD <= 8 ~ 1,\n          Air_LWD >= 26 & Air_LWD < 30 & LWD >= 9 & LWD <= 15 ~ 2,\n          Air_LWD >= 26 & Air_LWD < 30 & LWD >= 16 & LWD <= 22 ~ 3,\n          Air_LWD >= 26 & Air_LWD < 30 & LWD > 22 ~ 4,\n          \n          # Default (For temperatures out of the specified ranges or any other scenarios)\n          TRUE ~ 0  # Assigning a default value of 0\n        )\n      )\ndf_fast\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 31 √ó 6\n# Groups:   YEAR, MO [1]\n    YEAR    MO    DY Air_LWD   LWD   DSV\n   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <dbl>\n 1  2022     3     1    20.2     3     0\n 2  2022     3     2    19.2    10     2\n 3  2022     3     3    19.7    12     2\n 4  2022     3     4    19.9    10     2\n 5  2022     3     5    19.5     7     1\n 6  2022     3     6    19.0     9     2\n 7  2022     3     7    18.4     7     1\n 8  2022     3     8    19.2    10     2\n 9  2022     3     9    19.6    12     2\n10  2022     3    10    19.6    13     2\n# ‚Ñπ 21 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_fast2 <- df_fast |> \n  mutate(DSV2 = cumsum(DSV),\n  date = as.Date(sprintf('%04d-%02d-%02d', YEAR, MO, DY)))\n\ndf_fast2 |> \n  ggplot(aes(date, DSV))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#339966\")+\n  geom_line(aes(date, DSV2))+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 20, linetype = 2)+\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = as.Date(\"2022-03-04\"), y = 21.5, label = \"Action threshold\")+\n  r4pde::theme_r4pde()+\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Daily and cumulative DSV\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](warning-systems_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
