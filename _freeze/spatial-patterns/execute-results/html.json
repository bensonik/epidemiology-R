Such arrangement is the realization of the underlying dispersal of the pathogen, from one or several sources within and/or outside the area of interest, under the influence of physical, biological and environmental factors.\n\nThe study of spatial patterns is conducted at a specific time or multiple times during the epidemic. When assessed multiple times, both spatial and temporal processes can be characterized. Because epidemics change over time, it is expected that spatial patterns are not constant but change over time as well. Usually, plant pathologists are interested in determining spatial patterns at one or various spatial scales, depending on the objective of the study. The scale of interest may be a leaf or root, plant, field, municipality, state, country or even intercontinental area. The diseased units observed may vary from lesions on a single leaf to diseased fields in a large production region.\n\nThe patterns can be classified into two main types that occur naturally: **random** or **aggregated**. The random pattern originates because the chances for the units (leaf, plant, crop) to be infected are equal and low, and are largely independent from each other. In aggregated spatial patterns, such chances are unequal and there is dependency among the units. For example, a healthy unit close to a diseased unit is at higher risk than more distant units.\n\nLet's simulate in R two vectors (x,y) for the positions of diseased units that follow a random or an aggregated pattern. For the random pattern, we use `runif`, a function which generates random deviates from the uniform distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-patterns_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_eebd1ec29cdd566cadadd2a0fa595511'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)          # for reproducibility\nx <- runif(50, 0, 30)  # x vector\ny <- runif(50, 0, 30)  # y vector\ndat <- data.frame(x,y) # dataframe for plotting\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, the plot to visualize the random pattern.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-patterns_cache/html/fig-random_886d49dc9c6202bf90306aa2cb33326a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggthemes)\ntheme_set(theme_few())\n\npr <- dat |> # R base pipe operator\n  ggplot(aes(x, y))+\n  theme_grey(base_size = 16)+\n  geom_point(size =3, \n             color = \"darkred\")+\n  ylim(0,30)+\n  xlim(0,30)+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  labs(x = \"Distance x\", y = \"Distance y\", \n       title = \"Random\")\npr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Random pattern of a plant disease epidemic](spatial-patterns_files/figure-html/fig-random-1.png){#fig-random width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we can generate new x and y vectors using `rnbinom` function which allows generating values for the negative binomial distribution (which should give rise to aggregated patterns) with parameters `size` and `prob`.

The first generates a disease- or pathogen-only data where the units are located in a scatter plot where the user can define the number of cells of the grid as well as the number of points to be plotted and the realized pattern: random or aggregated.\n\n[![Screenshot of a Shiny app to simulate disease-only data in a grid](imgs/spatial_shiny.png){#fig-spatial1 fig-align=\"center\" width=\"521\"}](https://delponte.shinyapps.io/spatial/)\n\nThe second app generates an artificial plantation with presence-absence data in a 2D map. The user can define the number of rows and number of plants per row and the realized pattern: random or aggregated. The latter pattern can start from the center or border of the plantation. The app calculates the number of foci and the final incidence (proportion of diseased plants).\n\n[![Screenshot of a Shiny app to simulate a presence-absence data in a 2D map](imgs/spatial2_shiny.png){#fig-spatial2 fig-align=\"center\" width=\"521\"}](https://delponte.shinyapps.io/spatial2)\n",
