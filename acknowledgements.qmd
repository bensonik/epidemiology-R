## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Embarking on the journey of authoring "R for Plant Disease Epidemiology (R4PDE)" has been an enlightening voyage that has not only honed my understanding but also expanded the horizons of collaborative learning in the realm of plant disease epidemiology. This endeavor would not have been possible without the unwavering support and intellectual generosity of many individuals and institutions.

First and foremost, my heartfelt gratitude goes to Helen Pennington, who generously granted permission to use her evocative painting of coffee leaf rust for the book cover. Helen's artwork not only embellishes the cover but also encapsulates the essence of plant disease epidemiology, providing a visual narrative that complements the academic discourse.

I am equally indebted to Prof. Laurence V. Madden, whose magnanimity in allowing the use of data showcased in the seminal book "The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics" has enriched the analytical content of this publication. The data serves as a foundational element in illustrating key concepts, thereby enhancing the comprehension and engagement of our readers.

The collaborative spirit of the open-source community has been a cornerstone in refining and augmenting the content of "R for Plant Disease Epidemiology (R4PDE)". I am immensely thankful to those who took the time and effort to contribute fixes and improvements. Their engagements, whether through pull requests or other forms of contact, have been invaluable: Adam Sparks ([\@adamhsparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks)), Remco Stam ([\@remco-stam](https://github.com/remco-stam)), Tiago Olivoto ([\@TiagoOlivoto](https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto)), Monalisa De CÃ³l ([\@Monalisacdc](https://github.com/Monalisacdc)), and Juan Edwards Molina ([\@juanchiem](https://github.com/juanchiem)).
